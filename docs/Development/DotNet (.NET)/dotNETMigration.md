## Automatically Migrate Codebase to Latest .NET

The **.NET Upgrade Assistant** is a powerful tool designed to help you seamlessly **migrate your .NET Framework, .NET Core, or older .NET projects** to the latest version of .NET. Available as both a **Visual Studio extension** and a **command-line interface (CLI)**, it scans your code, flags compatibility issues, and guides you through the upgrade process.

### Key Features

- **Automated Code Analysis**: Identifies 
upgrade needs and generates a comprehensive report.
- **Guided Upgrade Paths**: Provides wizards for full-project or partial upgrades with multiple options.
- **Supports Multiple Project Types**: From ASP.NET and Azure Functions to Xamarin and .NET MAUI.
- **Flexible Upgrade Modes**: Choose between in-place, side-by-side, or incremental upgrades.
