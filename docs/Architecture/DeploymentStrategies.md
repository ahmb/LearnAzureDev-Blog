## Rollout Strategies 

| **Dimension**                    | **Blue-Green**                                                                                           | **Canary**                                                                                               | **Rolling**                                                                                             | **A/B Testing**                                                                                                 |

| **Description**                  | Maintains two identical environments. Traffic is switched from Blue (live) to Green (new) after testing. Best for high-risk apps needing instant rollback. | Releases new version to a small user group first to reduce risk.                                         | Gradually replaces old version with new one without downtime. Best for general-purpose apps.            | Splits traffic by user segments to test new features. Focuses more on user behavior than system functionality. |
| **Resource Requirements**       | High (requires duplicating the environment)                                                               | Moderate (only a portion of resources are duplicated)                                                     | Low (updates one pod at a time)                                                                          | Moderate to High (similar to Blue-Green or Canary)                                                              |
| **Complexity**                  | Moderate to High (managing two full environments)                                                         | Moderate (requires careful monitoring and traffic control)                                                | Low (Kubernetes automates much of the process)                                                           | High (complex criteria for routing and success metrics)                                                         |
| **Suitability for Large Apps**  | Very suitable (full testing before public release)                                                        | Suitable (allows segmental exposure and testing)                                                          | Suitable (steady update with minimal downtime)                                                           | Suitable (tests features by user segments)                                                                      |
| **Speed of Deployment**         | Fast (instant switch once version is ready)                                                               | Slow (depends on monitoring/results)                                                                      | Moderate (depends on deployment size)                                                                    | Variable (depends on test goals/duration)                                                                       |
| **Traffic Routing**             | Manual (switch between environments)                                                                      | Automated (gradual traffic shift)                                                                         | Automated (sequential update)                                                                            | Automated and/or Manual (based on user segmentation)                                                            |
| **Feedback and Metrics**        | Direct (from full environment)                                                                            | Immediate & continuous (real-time monitoring of changes)                                                  | Continuous (through the update)                                                                          | Detailed (based on user interactions)                                                                           |
| **Speed of Rollback**           | High control, immediate (switch back to previous environment)                                             | Fast, low-risk (redirect traffic)                                                                         | Slow, complex (sequential revert)                                                                        | Fast to Moderate (depends on traffic control setup)                                                             |
| **Repo Management Complexity**  | High (two environments to manage)                                                                         | Moderate (managed within single repo or feature branches)                                                 | Low (single process)                                                                                      | Moderate to High (multiple branches/configurations)                                                             |
| **Effort (E2E Time)**           | High (requires full setup and teardown)                                                                   | Moderate to High (monitoring and validation)                                                              | Moderate (continuous updates)                                                                            | High (extended behavior analysis/testing)                                                                       |
| **Overall Cost $**              | High (due to duplicated resources and management)                                                         | Moderate to High (monitoring + testing phases)                                                            | Low to Moderate (most efficient)                                                                         | High (testing, multiple configs, longer rollouts)
